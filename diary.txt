MVP: 
- a program that prints out words; checks input and gives visual feedback if the word typed is the same as the word printed on screen

first story:
- I want a dictionary to print out words from in random order
* created a dictionary class
* first test: create an empty dictionary
* first test passses, an object is created
* 2nd test: create a dictionary with 1 words
* 3rd test: check that the word is correctly stored in dictionary
* 3rd test: problems with the global variables in python, had to add "global" keyword and new initialization to the constructor
* small test refactoring, moved constructor call to SetUp method; named all dict instances global
* 4th test: can retrieve the size of the dictionary correctly if dictionary created with one word
* 5th test: can retrieve the size of the dictionary correctly if dictionary created with two words
* the first() call was failing because when initializing the class with only the word, the language transforms each letter of the word into an element of a list, which caused the size() and first() methods to fail. Fixed by initializing with one word with []'s
* 6TH test: was a bit lost. decided to implement "next()" for the dictionary. Planning to use use that as the iteration method...
* Refactor: remove "first()", will use "next()" only
* Refatoring: tests and class to accomodate sets of 2 items a word in text and the WAV file to play when playing that word
* 7th test: checked that I can get both the word and the text version of the word
