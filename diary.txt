MVP: 
- a program that prints out words; checks input and gives visual feedback if the word typed is the same as the word printed on screen

first story:
- I want a dictionary to print out words from in random order
* created a dictionary class
* first test: create an empty dictionary
* first test passses, an object is created
* 2nd test: create a dictionary with 1 words
* 3rd test: check that the word is correctly stored in dictionary
* 3rd test: problems with the global variables in python, had to add "global" keyword and new initialization to the constructor
